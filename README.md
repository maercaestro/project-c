# Project-C

This repo is just a collection of all the program that I wrote in C while learning the languages. I would list down and update all the programs time by time.

**1. Calculator**
[calculator](calculator/)
This is a simple calculator program written in C. No GUI involved

**2. Fast-Inverse**
[fast-inverse](fast-inverse/)
This is a simple demonstration of fast-inverse square root algorithm introduced in Quake III

**3. Hello World**
[hello-world](hello-world/)
Do we really need an explanation for this?

**4. Snake-Game**
[snake-game](snake-game/)
Snake-game build in C. Need to use lncurses header since typical header is only compatible with Windows not mac
To compile, please run the code as below

```
cc snake.c -o snake -lncurses
